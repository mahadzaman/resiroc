          You can manage your privacy settings within your browser or our
          applications and services (where applicable).
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the purposes described in this section 3, we may also
          use information we gather to deliver targeted advertising, marketing
          (including in-product messaging) or information to you which may be
          useful, based on your use of the website, applications or services or

        <h5>Mobile Data</h5>

        <p>
          We may obtain information through mobile applications that you or your
          users install on their mobile devices to access and use our website,
          applications or services or which you or your users use to provide
          other services related to that mobile application (for example, to
          sync information from our application or service with such mobile
          application). These mobile applications may be our own mobile
          applications or those belonging to third parties. Where the mobile
          application belongs to a third party, you must read that third party’s
          own privacy notice as it will apply to your use of that third party
          mobile application. We are not responsible for such third party mobile
          applications and their use of your personal information.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mobile applications may provide us with information related to a
          user’s use of that mobile application and use of our applications and
          services accessed using that mobile application. We may use such
          information to provide and improve the mobile application or our own
          application or services. For example, activity undertaken within a
          mobile application may be logged.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can configure our mobile application’s privacy settings on your
          device but this may affect the performance of that mobile application
          and the way it interacts with our applications and services.
        </p>

        <h5>Data analytics, and benchmarking</h5>

          the use of statistical analysis, benchmarking and forecasting
          services, predictive analysis and artificial intelligence/machine
          learning.

          we) may contact you with information about their products or services
          which we feel may be of interest to you. We or they may wish to
          contact you for this purpose by telephone, post, SMS or email. You

          marketing purposes. You may also request at any time that we do not
          share your information with third parties referred to in this

        <p>
          Where you respond to communications we post on third-party platforms

          also share your information with those third parties in order to serve
          targeted advertising/content to you via the relevant third party
          platform based on your profile/interests. Your information is used by
          the third-party platform provider to identify your account and serve

          via the privacy settings on the relevant provider's platform and you

          for purposes set out in our Privacy Notice, we may not be able to
          provide you with access to all or parts of our website, applications,
          and services.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will retain your personal information for the duration of our
          business relationship and afterwards for as long as is necessary and
          relevant for our legitimate business purposes or as otherwise
          permitted by applicable laws and regulations. Where we no longer need
          your personal information, we will dispose of it in a secure manner

        <h5>7. Changes to this Privacy Notice</h5>

        <h5>9. Transfers outside of the European Economic Area and the UK</h5>
        <p>
          Personal information in the European Union and the UK is protected by
          data protection laws but other countries do not necessarily protect
          your personal information in the same way.
          <br />
          <br />
          Our website and some of our applications or services or parts of them
          may also be hosted in the United States or otherwise outside of the UK
          or the EEA (which means all the EU countries plus Norway, Iceland and
          Liechtenstein) (together “EEA”) and this means that we may transfer
          any information which is submitted by you through the website or the
          application or service outside the EEA to the United States or to
          other territories outside of the EEA. When you send an email to us,
          this may also be stored on email servers which are hosted outside the
          EEA.
          <br />
          <br />
          We may use service providers based outside of the EEA to help us
          provide our website, applications and services to you (for example,
          platform and payment providers who help us deliver our applications
          and services, or advertising or execute your payments) and this means
          that we may transfer your information to service providers outside the
          EEA for the purpose of providing our applications, advertising and
          services to you.
          <br />
          <br />
          We take steps to ensure that where your information is transferred
          outside of the EEA by our service providers and hosting
          providers, appropriate measures and controls in place to protect that
          information in accordance with applicable data protection laws and
          regulations. For example, we may share information with our group
          companies or affiliates based outside the EEA for the purposes
          envisaged by this Privacy Notice. All Resiroc group companies are
          subject to Resiroc group data protection policies designed to protect
          data in accordance with EU data protection laws. In each case, such
          transfers are made in accordance with the requirements of Regulations
          (EU) 2016/679 (the General Data Protection Regulations or “GDPR”) and
          may be based on the use of the European Commission’s Standard Model
          Clauses for transfers of personal data outside the EEA.
          <br />
          <br />
          By using our website, products or services or by interacting with us
          in the ways described in this Privacy Notice, you consent to the
          transfer of your information outside the EEA in the circumstances set
          out in this Privacy Notice. If you do not want your information to be
          transferred outside the EEA you should not use our website,
          applications or services.
        </p>
        <h5>10. Other sites and social media</h5>
        <p>
          If you follow a link from our website, application or service to
          another site or service, this Privacy Notice will no longer apply. We
          are not responsible for the information handling practices of third
          party sites or services and we encourage you to read the privacy
          notices appearing on those sites or services.
          <br />
          <br />
          Our websites, applications or services may enable you to share
          information with social media sites, or use social media sites to
          create your account or to connect your social media account. Those
          social media sites may automatically provide us with access to certain
          personal information retained by them about you (for example any
          content you have viewed). You should be able to manage your privacy
          settings from within your own third party social media account(s) to
          manage what personal information you enable us to access from that
          account.
        </p>
        <h5>11. Cookies, analytics and traffic data</h5>
        <p>
          Cookies are small text files which are transferred from our websites,
          applications or services and stored on your device. We use cookies to
          help us provide you with a personalised service, and to help make our
          websites, applications and services better for you.
          <br />
          <br />
          Our cookies may be session cookies (temporary cookies that identify
          and track users within our websites, applications or services which
          are deleted when you close your browser or leave your session in the
          application or service) or persistent cookies (cookies which enable
          our websites, applications or services to “remember” who you are and
          to remember your preferences within our websites, applications or
          services and which will stay on your computer or device after you
          close your browser or leave your session in the application or
          service).
          <br />
          We use the following different types of cookies:
          <br />
          <b>Strictly necessary cookies</b>
          <br />
          These are cookies which are needed for our websites, applications or
          services to function properly, for example, these cookies allow you to
          access secure areas of our website or to remember what you have put
          into your shopping basket.
          <br />
          <b>Performance cookies and analytics technologies</b>
          <br />
          These cookies collect information about how visitors and users use our
          websites, applications and services, for instance which functionality
          visitors use most often, and if they get error mesResirocs from areas
          of the websites, applications or services. These cookies don't collect
          information that identifies a visitor or user directly. We only use
          these cookies to improve how our website, applications and services
          work.
          <br />
          <b>Functionality cookies</b>
          <br />
          These cookies allow our websites, applications and services to
          remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the
          region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. These
          cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text
          size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customise. They
          may also be used to provide services you have asked for. The
          information these cookies collect may be anonymised and they cannot
          track your browsing activity on other websites.
          <br />
          <b>Targeting or advertising cookies</b>
          <br />
          These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and
          your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you
          see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the
          advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks
          with the website operators’ permission. They remember that you have
          visited a website and this information is shared with other
          organisations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or
          advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by
          the other organisation.
          <br />
          <b>Web beacons, tags and parameter tracking</b>
          <br />
          We also use cookies and similar software known as web beacons and tags
          to track where users have visited our website after clicking through
          from one of our advertisements on another website or in emails and to
          collect details of any products or services purchased and other key
          user actions and events. These web beacons and tags collect limited
          information which may sometimes include information which identifies
          particular users. It is not possible to refuse the use of web beacons
          and tags. However, because they are used in conjunction with cookies,
          you can effectively disable them by setting your browser to restrict
          or block cookies or by opting out of Performance Cookies through the
          Cookies Settings link.
          <br />
          <b>IP Address, device tracking and traffic data</b>
          <br />
          We keep a record of traffic data which is logged automatically by our
          servers, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, device
          information, the website that you visited before ours and the website
          you visit after leaving our site. This may include using certain
          masked (unidentifiable) data to track where users switch between
          different devices when accessing the website. We also collect some
          site, application and service statistics such as access rates, page
          hits and page views. We are not able to identify any individual from
          traffic or device tracking data or site statistics.
          <br />
          <b>Managing the use of your cookies</b>
          <br />
          You can use your browser to manage your use of cookies:
          <br />
          <b>Your browser settings</b>
          <br />
          You may be able to configure your browser or our website, application
          or service to restrict cookies or block all cookies if you wish,
          however if you disable cookies you may find this affects your ability
          to use certain parts of our website, applications or services. You
          will also likely see the cookie preference centre whenever you use the
          Resiroc.net website.
