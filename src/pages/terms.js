        <b>Interactive services</b>
        <br />
        <p>
          We may from time to time provide interactive services on our website.
          &nbsp;If we do provide any interactive service, we will provide clear
          information to you about the kind of service offered.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users from third
          parties when they use any interactive service provided on our website,
          and we will decide in each case whether it is appropriate to use
          moderation of the relevant service (including what kind of moderation
          to use) in the light of those risks. However, we are under no
          obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any interactive service we
          provide on our website.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we do decide to monitor or moderate an interactive service, we will
          normally provide you with a means of contacting the moderator, should
          you need to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our interactive services are not intended for use by children. Parents
          and guardians should not permit their children to use our interactive
          services, as these are only intended for use by businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you use our interactive services, you will also need to understand
          and comply with our content standards.
        </p>
        <p>Content standards</p>
        <p>
          If you contribute material to our website or forums you agree that any
          material you contribute will:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>comply with all applicable laws and regulations;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              be factually accurate and/or will represent your genuinely held
              belief or opinion;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>not be defamatory, offensive, hateful or inflammatory; and</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              not infringe confidentiality, or any copyright or intellectual
              property rights of another person.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You also agree that we can use any content you contribute to our
          website whenever and wherever we think appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>Our suspension and termination rights</p>
        <p>
          The terms set out in this section 3 are intended to protect us, our
          website and its users, so a failure to comply with this section
          constitutes a serious breach of these terms. If we believe you have
          breached this section 3, we may do any or all of the following (as
          well as take any other action we feel is appropriate):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              issue a warning to you and ask you to take certain steps to
              rectify your behaviour.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              suspend your right to access our website, either temporarily or
              permanently.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              take legal action against you, including to recover any loss we
              have suffered due to your actions.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>disclose information to law enforcement authorities.</p>

        <h5>7. Intellectual property rights</h5>

          enjoyment of our website by anyone else.
        </p>
        <p>
          We own various trade marks and registered trade marks (the
          &quot;marks&quot;), a list of which can be obtained from us. You may
          not use those marks, and/or any third-party trade marks that appear on
          our website, other than as permitted by express written licence from
          the licensor or by law. In particular, but without limit, you may not
          use the marks as meta-tags and you may not sponsor them in search

        </p>
        <p>
          We may grant you express permissions relating to use of material on
          our website from time to time but except where we do so, nothing in
          these terms or on our website confers any licence or right to use any
          material on our website without the prior written approval of the
          owner, whether that is us or our licensors.
        </p>
        <h5>8. What happens if things don&apos;t go as planned?</h5>
        <p>
          We will always try to ensure our website and the material on it meets
          the standards we have promised and that you can use our website as
          intended in relation to your business. &nbsp;However, because of the
          nature of our website and the wide range of information, products and
          services we provide, sometimes things may go wrong. If we are at
          fault, we will always try to resolve any problems we have caused, but
          unfortunately we will not compensate you for any loss or damage you
          might suffer (of any nature and however caused) in connection with:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>our website; or</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              your use, inability to use, or results of the use of our website,
              any websites linked to it and any materials posted on it; or
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              the use of (or any inability to use) any interactive service on
              our website, whether the service is moderated or not.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Of course, this does not affect our liability for death or personal
          injury arising from our negligence, or our liability for fraud
          (including fraudulent misrepresentation) in the unlikely event that
          this should happen, or any other liability which we are not allowed to
          limit or exclude by law.
        </p>
        <h5>10. Cookies</h5>
        <p>
          We use cookies on our website (which are small text files that allow
          our website to &quot;remember&quot; who you are). Further information
          about cookies, how we use them to store and access information about
          you and how you can choose to reject cookies can be found in our
          Privacy Policy.

        <h5>11. Your personal information</h5>
        <p>
          Our website includes areas where you are requested to provide
          information about yourself. &nbsp;Any personal data you provide to us

          Policy which also forms part of these terms.
        </p>
        <h5>12. General</h5>
        <p>
          If a court or other competent authority rules that any of these terms
          are void or unenforceable in whole or part, the other terms and the
          remainder of the void or unenforceable term will still be valid.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing in these terms excludes or limits our liability for death or
          personal injury due to our negligence, or our liability for fraudulent
          misrepresentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a consumer, your statutory legal rights are not affected by
          these terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we fail to exercise or delay in exercising a right or remedy
          provided by these terms or by law, that does not mean we give up those
          or any other rights or remedies. We reserve the right to exercise
          those rights or remedies in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          These terms and the use of our website and its content shall be
          governed by and construed in all respects in accordance with English
          law. We and you agree that the English courts shall have exclusive
          jurisdiction to settle any claims or proceedings relating to these
          terms or their subject matter.
